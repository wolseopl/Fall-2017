# Fall-2017

Hi,

This is my first time using github since I made an account quite a while ago..

The name is Daniel and I'm desparately wanting to make some serious changes in my life.. or I might call it a career shift.

Excited and worried at the same time as the time is ticking.

Trying to be positive but not naive.

This is my commitment: I will NOT fall behind. I will NOT give up. I will succeed.
